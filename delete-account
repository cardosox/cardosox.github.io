    <h1>How to Delete Your Account</h1>
    <p>You can delete your account directly from within the app. Once you enter the app and select the <strong>Online</strong> mode, you'll be prompted to choose between <strong>Setup Match</strong> or <strong>My Team Builder</strong>.</p>
    <p>After choosing <strong>Setup Match</strong> and completing the login (or silent sign-in), you will see a floating action button labeled <strong>Actions</strong> at the bottom of the screen. Tap this button, and among the options, you'll find <strong>Delete Account</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you need further assistance, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:gamebtmt@gmail.com">gamebtmt@gmail.com</a>.</p>
