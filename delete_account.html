    <h1>How to Delete Your Account</h1>
    <p>You can delete your account directly from within the app. Once you enter the app and select the <strong>Online</strong> mode, you'll be prompted to choose between <strong>Setup Match</strong> or <strong>My Team Builder</strong>.</p>
    <p>After choosing <strong>Setup Match</strong> and completing the login (or silent sign-in), you will see a floating action button labeled <strong>Actions</strong> at the bottom of the screen. Tap this button, and among the options, you'll find <strong>Delete Account</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>When you delete your account, the following data will be permanently deleted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your account information (including email address and user ID)</li>
        <li>Your game progress, including custom teams, match history, and other related data</li>
        <li>Any other personal data stored in the app</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some data, such as app usage logs or anonymous performance statistics, may be retained for compliance or analytical purposes, but this data is not tied to your personal information.</p>
